- 1st assignment: Find project

I built it in C++ cause it'ss easier for me. Code can be found in Find.cpp
When executed (Between\x64\Debug\FindProject.exe) it displays a menu where you can execute the test or the find function.


- 2nd assignment: Shapes project

C++ shapes library can be found in ShapesLib.cpp
Shapes.py can not be executed because I couldn't import the C++ library. I never used mixed C++ and python, so I chose to be honest.
